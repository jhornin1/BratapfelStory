Story

Once upon a time, Schneewittchen, fled from the Evil Queen and found herself deep in a mysterious forest. (JGess)
But as she fled, she stubbed her toe on a branch and cried "Ah! I stubbed my flughafen toe!" (jhornin1)
Someone standing nearby marvelled at her language, "You could participate in wettbewerbsfaehig cursing!"
Curiously Schneewittchen asked the bystander where she could take place in such an event, in which they replied, "In a abondoned Ratskeller downtown."
"Is this a formal establishment, do I need to change into my Dirndel?" Schneewittchen asked the kind stranger. (cspeidel)
