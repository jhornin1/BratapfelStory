Story

Once upon a time, Schneewittchen, fled from the Evil Queen and found herself deep in a mysterious forest. (JGess)
But as she fled, she stubbed her toe on a branch and cried "Ah! I stubbed my flughafen toe!" (jhornin1)
Someone standing nearby marvelled at her language, "You could participate in wettbewerbsfaehig cursing!"
Curiously Schneewittchen asked the bystander where she could take place in such an event, in which they replied, "In the abondoned Ratskeller downtown." (jhollin7)
"Is this a formal establishment, do I need to change into my Dirndel?" Schneewittchen asked the kind stranger. (cspeidel)
"Nah, it is super casual," said the mysterious stranger. "Just be sure you bring it hard like Rammstein!" (JGess)
Schneewittchen was pleased as she made her way to the Ratskeller, until she found the Evil Queen Johan Gauss -- whose horrid
demenor was a result of being named for an old, dead mathematician. (jhornin1)
Schneewittchen was shook. As she prepared to run, she heard the Evil Queen say "don't get your Lederhose in a knot. I'm here on vacation, you're not even on my radar anymore."
